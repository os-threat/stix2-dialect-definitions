Unlike the other motivations, a coerced person does not act for personal gain, but out of fear of incurring a loss."}, {"key": "dominance", "label": "A desire to assert superiority over someone or something else.\n\nAdversaries who are seeking dominance over a target are focused on using their power to force their target into submission or irrelevance. Dominance may be found with ideology in some state-sponsored attacks and with notoriety in some cyber vandalism-based attacks."}, {"key": "ideology", "label": "A passion to express a set of ideas, beliefs, and values that may shape and drive harmful and illegal acts.\n\nAdversaries who act for ideological reasons (e.g., political, religious, human rights, environmental, desire to cause chaos/anarchy, etc.) are not usually motivated primarily by the desire for profit; they are acting on their own sense of morality, justice, or political loyalty.\nFor example, an activist group may sabotage a company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s equipment because they believe the company is harming the environment."}, {"key": "notoriety", "label": "Seeking prestige or to become well known through some activity.\n\nAdversaries motivated by notoriety are often seeking either personal validation or respect within a community and staying covert is not a priority.
