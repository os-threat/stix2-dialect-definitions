    "prevention":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to prevent a known or expected security event, incident, or threat from occurring. Prevention playbooks are often designed and deployed as part of best practices to safeguard organizations from known and perceived threats and behaviors associated with suspicious activity. For example, a prevention playbook can contain the specific actions that need to be deployed on certain systems to prevent a new attack or campaign. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "notification":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to notify and disseminate information and other playbooks about a security event, incident, or threat. For example, a notification playbook can be used to notify multiple entities about a new attack or campaign and disseminate information or playbooks to deal with it as quickly as possible. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "detection":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to detect a known security event, known or expected security-relevant activity, or for threat hunting. For example, a detection playbook can contain the actions needed to help organizations detect a specific attack or campaign. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "engagement":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to engage in denial, deception, strategic planning, and analysis activity to support adversary engagement. Whereas attack playbooks leverage actions against known defenders to test an environment, engagement playbooks define actions and countermeasures against adversaries to increase their cost to operate and decrease the value of their operations. For example, an engagement playbook can contain the actions needed to provide misinformation about data or systems to decrease the value an adversary places on the assets, or it can contain the actions needed to disrupt network access to increase the adversaryâ€™s operational costs. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "investigation":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to investigate what affects a security event, incident, or other security-relevant activity has caused. Investigation playbooks will likely inform other subsequent actions upon completion of the investigation. For example, an investigation playbook can contain the actions needed to check various systems for suspicious activity. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks--v2.0]",
    "mitigation":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to mitigate a security event or incident that has occurred when remediation is not initially possible. Organizations often choose to mitigate a security event or incident until they can actually remediate it. Mitigation playbooks are designed to reduce or limit the impact of suspicious or confirmed malicious activity. For example, a mitigation playbook can contain the specific actions to be used to quarantine affected users/devices/applications from the network temporarily to prevent additional problems. Mitigation usually precedes remediation, after which the mitigation actions are reversed. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "remediation":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to remediate, resolve, or fix the resultant state of a security event or incident and return the system, device, or network back to a nominal operating state. Remediation playbooks can fix affected assets by selectively correcting problems due to malicious activity by reverting the system or network to a known good state. For example, a remediation playbook can contain the specific actions that need to be deployed to ensure that a system or device is no longer infected with some malware. If mitigation steps were previously applied, they might need to be undone during remediation; however, this is all implementation-specific and dependent on how the playbooks were created and executed. [CACAO-Security-Playbooks-v2.0]",
    "attack":	"A playbook that is primarily focused on the orchestration steps required to execute a penetration test or perform adversarial emulation. These playbooks can help an organization test and verify the security controls in a specific environment and potentially identify vulnerabilities or other changes necessary to improve defensive posture within that environment. For example, an attack playbook can contain the specific actions that a red-team should perform that are within the scope and rules of engagement for a specific penetration test. An attack playbook may also be used to capture, in a structured way, the sequence of an adversary's behavior as described in a text-based cyber threat intelligence (CTI) report.
